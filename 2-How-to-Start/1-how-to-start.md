# How to Start?

If you are at an AWS hosted event (such as AWS re:Invent, AWS Summit, Immersions Day, on-site Workshop or other event hosted by AWS employees), you will be provided with a temporary Event Engine AWS account for the workshop. Please follow the [AWS Event](2-How-to-Start/2-aws-event.md) instructions to access your Event Engine AWS account.

If you are running this workshop by yourself, your account must have the ability to create new IAM roles and scope other IAM permissions. Please follow [Self Paced Labs](2-How-to-Start/3-self-paced-labs.md) instructions to prepare your AWS account.
